## üí° Installation Methods

### Requirements

- Unlocked bootloader
- Custom Recovery (TWRP/OrangeFox) or adb sideload
- Supported ROM (AOSP, MIUI/HyperOS, LOS, CLO/CAF)
- Backup of stock kernel

### Method 1: Auto-detection via File Naming

- The installer will detect your ROM automatically based on the filename:

| ROM Type           | Filename Example                |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| MIUI / HyperOS     | FusionX-vX.X-`MIUI`.zip         |
| AOSP w/ LOS IR     | FusionX-vX.X-`IR`.zip           |
| AOSP (standard)    | FusionX-vX.X-`AOSP`.zip              |


- The installer also detects your CPU frequency of the prime core:

| CPU Type         | Detection Method                     | Example Filename                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| MAX   | Prime core freq = `3.2 GHz`         | FusionX-vX.X-ROM-.zip (blank)      |
| BALANCE   | Prime core freq = `2.8 GHz`         | FusionX-vX.X-ROM-`BAL`.zip       |
| EFFICIENT   | Prime core freq = `2.5 GHz`         | FusionX-vX.X-ROM-`EFF`.zip       |

Just flash normally in your custom recovery.

### Method 2: Manual Selection (ADB Sideload or Custom Recoveries)

1. Boot into recovery and flash the kernel zip
2. volume keys to choose your ROM/CPU freq type:
3. Confirm your choice when prompted
